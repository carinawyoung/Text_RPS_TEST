# Writing tests for a text-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game

This was a simple Rock/Paper/Scissors game I coded with prompts from codecademy.com.
I've been wanting to work on writing more tests, so I decided
to use Node.js and Jest and add unit tests and an integration test.

I found I really like Jest - it's a well-organized and straightforward testing framework, great for my first JavaScript testing!
